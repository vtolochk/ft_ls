# My implementation of ls command 
## ft_ls
In this project I recode the systemâ€™s command ls. It works fine on OS X El Capitan, I didn't test it on other OS's.
It has no memory leaks. My ls supports the following flags: -A -R -@ -a -l -f -r -t -1. You can read about it in man.
These flags work like in standard ls. You need to use Makefile to compile this program. Binary will have name ft_ls.
